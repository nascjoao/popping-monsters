### About
Popping Monsters was developed as an experiment, a practice for my skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
It is a simple game (my first game ü§©Ô∏è) and you can check how to play it [here](#how-to-play).

### How to play

#### Goal
Pop the monsters as many as you can. The monsters appear and stand on the screen for a while. If you do not pop them, they will disappear.
Losing 10 monsters the game ends. How many can you pop?

#### Desktop
Go to the official website [pop.joaonasc.dev](https://pop.joaonasc.dev), click on the Play button and the game will start.
Drive the cursor to the monsters, when it hits a monster, the monster will disappear and will be counted to your score. Try to not lose them!

#### Mobile
Go to the official website [pop.joaonasc.dev](https://pop.joaonasc.dev) and install/add the app to your phone. After installing it, open the game and a
Play button will be displayed. Tap this button to start the game. When the game starts, the monsters will spawn. 
Tap a monster and it will disappear being counted to your score. Try to not lose them!

### Technologies
Popping Monsters runs only with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and has no backend.<br>
The _best score_ is registered with the localStorage.

A manifest file was written for running it as a PWA on mobile.

### Thank you
